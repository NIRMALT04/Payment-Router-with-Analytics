# Intelligent Payment Router with Real-time Analytics

A production-ready MCP Gradio Server for intelligent payment routing with real-time analytics, built for the Gradio MCP Hackathon.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an intelligent payment routing system that:
- Routes transactions to optimal payment service providers (PSPs) using ML
- Provides real-time analytics through Gradio dashboard
- Integrates with AI assistants through MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Simulates real-world payment processing scenarios

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
┌─ MCP Server Layer (AI Integration)
├─ Gradio Dashboard (Real-time Analytics UI)
├─ Payment Router Engine (ML-based routing)
├─ Transaction Simulator (Multi-PSP simulation)
├─ Analytics Engine (Success rates, costs, latency)
└─ Fraud Detection Module (Real-time scoring)
```

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Payment Routing
- ML-based routing decisions considering success rates, costs, and latency
- Real-time learning from transaction outcomes
- Support for multiple payment service providers (PSPs)
- A/B testing framework for routing strategies

### 2. Real-time Analytics Dashboard
- Live transaction monitoring with Gradio
- Success rate tracking by PSP, country, payment method
- Cost optimization analytics
- Fraud detection alerts

### 3. MCP Integration
- Expose payment analytics to AI assistants
- Conversational interface for payment data queries
- Automated reporting and insights generation

### 4. Production Features
- High-throughput transaction processing simulation
- Circuit breaker patterns for PSP failures
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Data persistence and historical analysis
